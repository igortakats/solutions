In fact, the problem can be solved by handling relation not found gracefully. For instance, the strategy to look up relation could be:
1. Look up related entity with the max revision number equal or less than the targeted entity's revision number.
2. If not found, look up related entity with the min revision number larger than the targeted entity's revision number.
3. If not found, look up related entity in "current" version.
4. If not found, return null or empty entity with id field populated.
