Configuring the Service
===========================================================================================================

Ensure you have administrator access to the Windows server on which JBoss is installed, and that you have a text editor that supports 
search and replace (such as Notepad). It is also handy, although not required, for the server to have unrestricted web access.

Procedure

Complete these steps:

1.    	On the WWW.JBOSS.ORG/JBOSSWEB/DOWNLOADS web site, search for the current packages of the "Jboss Web Native Connectors", and download 
		the binaries appropriate for the Windows operating system you are using. For example, if the current package is at release 2.0.10, 
		then download the zip file for binaries 2.0.10-windows x64.

2.    	Unzip the downloaded archive file to the JBoss root directory. For example:

        C:\jboss-as-7.1.1.Final

      	If prompted to do so, overwrite any existing files with the same names.

3.    	Use your text editor to open the service.bat file under the <JBOSS_ROOT>\bin directory. Save a copy of the file as service.old so you 
		have a backup.

4.    	Set the SVCNAME, SVCDISP and SVCDESC properties to something meaningful. For example:

        set SVCNAME=JBoss7server
        set SVCDISP=JBoss Server for CSP release X
        set SVCDESC=JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final - Windows x64 - CSP release X

5.		Comment out the JAVA_OPTS property by adding REM to the beginning of the line. For example:

        REM set JAVA_OPTS=-X

6.    	Replace all occurrences of run.bat with standalone.bat.

7.    	Replace all occurrences of run.log with standalone.log.

8.    	Replace all occurrences of the command

        	call shutdown -S < .s.lock >> shutdown.log 2>&1

  		with this command

        	call jboss-cli.bat --connect --command=:shutdown >> shutdown.log 2>&1

9.	    Save the modified service.bat file.

10.	    Launch the Windows command line and execute the following command to install and register the "JBoss Server for CSP release X" service:

        service.bat install

11.    Open Server Manager > Configuration > Services and verify that the "JBoss Server for CSP release X" service was registered.

12.    (Optional) Change the Startup Type for this service to Automatic.

13.    Start the "JBoss Service for CSP release X" service.

14.    Check the log file <JBOSS_ROOT>\bin\standalone.log to verify that the JBoss server started up successfully.
