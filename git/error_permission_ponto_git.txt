Git's famous “ERROR: Permission to .git denied to user”

After Googling for few days, i found this is the only one question are similar to my situations.

Someday i just solved the problem!

I think i have to write down my answer here to help the incoming searches.

Here is what i did:

1. Open "Keychain Access.app" (You can find it in Spotlight or LaunchPad)

2.  Select "All items" in Category

3. Search "git"

4. Delete every old & strange items
Try to Push again and it just WORKED

Glad I decided to google this instead of following the lack of detail on github's support page – ivandov Jul 12 '16 at 2:37

Hell yes, finally, after struggling with countless SSH keys, this is the answer that worked! Seems that Mac and https access uses the Keychain. Crazy. – Patrick Chu Nov 27 '16 at 19:30 
  	 	
Thanks! I'm using two differents accounts (work and personal), is it supposed that I have to do this everytime I'm pushing? I mean, it works but it's just annoying. – Angie Alejo Nov 30 '16 at 19:13
